# 🏠 AI Risk Assessment for Insurance using CPTED

This project proposes an AI system for property insurance appraisal, based on **CPTED** (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design) theory for selecting relevant features in risk assessment.

The goal is to support insurers with an advanced decision-making tool that integrates structured property data, territorial information, and satellite image analysis to generate a risk score for the area.

## 📌 Project Description

The model combines several data sources:

- **Property data:** square footage, presence of alarm systems, and other structural features.
- **Street features:** obtained via OpenStreetMap.
- **Territorial features:** extracted from Google Maps satellite images, retrieved using the property address.
- **Visual analysis:** instance segmentation using YOLOv8.

All features are aggregated in an **AdaBoost** model, which produces a risk score easily accessible through a graphical interface for insurers.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- AdaBoost (Machine Learning)  
- YOLOv8 (Instance Segmentation)  
- OpenStreetMap API  
- Google Maps Satellite API  
- Roboflow (dataset labeling)

## 🔎 System Pipeline

1. Collect property data.
2. Extract territorial features via OpenStreetMap.
3. Download satellite images based on the property address.
4. Perform instance segmentation with YOLOv8.
5. Merge features into an AdaBoost model.
6. Generate the risk score.
7. Visualize results through a graphical interface.

## ⚠️ Repository Notes

Due to GitHub file size limits, the full dataset used during project development is not included. Some files, particularly satellite images and complete datasets, are excluded.

This project is primarily for demonstration and academic purposes. The code may not be fully integrated or production-ready. The goal is to showcase the methodological approach, techniques used, and the general pipeline functionality.
